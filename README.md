# Random World Generator

This is a game where a user-controlled avatar attempts to reach a randomly-positioned end goal before enemies catch it. We developed an algorithm to arbitrarily generate worlds consisting of fully connected hallways and rooms based on a user-inputted seed. We also incorporated additional challenges such as multiple enemies which optimally move using search algorithms as well as flickering lights. The user also has the option of exiting the game and continuing from their previous save file!
